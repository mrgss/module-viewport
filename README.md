## module-viewport
Handles the viewports made by the engine.

## What are viewports?

Viewports are basically clips of an area of your window, so when you draw a viewport you only draw inside determined bounds and
not the entire screen. Also viewports have the advantage of being z-indexed, so no matter their contents will never be overlapped.
